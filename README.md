Experimenting with Queryable State in Flink

Queryable state interfact for the ADS-B streamer (based off of the excellent example from
Data Artisans - https://github.com/dataArtisans/queryable-state-demo).  Run this against
the Job Manager running the ADS-B streamer, and query for the ICAO you want to 
look up.
